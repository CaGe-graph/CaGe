
# CaGe, the Chemical & abstract Graph environment
#
# - configuration file -

# There is a substitution mechanism for configuration values --
# substitutions start with $, then some opening bracket, then the
# corresponding closing bracket.
# 
# To substitute environment variables, such as PATH, use the format
# (e.g.) ${PATH} for PATH, the braces {} are required.
# 
# To substitute Java system properties, use angle brackets [] -- note:
# the 'cage.sh' script tries to set a system property called CaGe.InstallDir
# to the installation directory.
# 
# To substitute other configuration values from this file, use parentheses ()
# -- be sure to avoid circular substitutions.


# If this is true (or yes or 1), let user edit generator and embedder commands
# and suppress the warning about Rasmol's unreliability.
CaGe.ExpertMode:	false


# In the following settings (those starting with "CaGe."), three
# directories are frequently mentioned:
# - The "install directory", where CaGe is installed (this very file
#   is in the install directory). 'cage.sh' finds out where this is and
#   creates a system property that contains an absolute path to it.
#   This is used wherever $[CaGe.InstallDir] is mentioned in this file.
#   (Should CaGe not find out its install directory, which we only
#   expect if CaGe is not started by the "cage.sh" script, the
#   start directory is assumed to be the install directory.)
# - The "start directory", from where the call to start CaGe is issued.
# - "RunDir", which CaGe subprocesses change into before generators and
#   embedders are run, and where CaGe also looks for files to read or save.
#   This is the next configuration option in this file.
# Keep these three places in mind and don't be confused by the fact
# that by default, RunDir is set to "." which makes it equal to the
# start directory.

# RunDir is where generator and embedder processes are run --
# saved data files, log or error output files are also found here.
# - This directory is relative to the start directory (cf. above).
# - The default "." is probably what users expect -- they can save
#   files and after finishing CaGe will find them in the directory
#   where they made the call. The programmer would however recommend
#   some absolute location below the install directory, as CaGe can
#   create quite a few files with quite long names rather quickly.
#   The installation includes an empty subdirectory called "Data"
#   and here, commented out, is a setting for RunDir that uses it.
